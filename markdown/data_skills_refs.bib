  abstract = {Across scientific disciplines, there is a rapidly growing recognition of the need for more statistically robust, transparent approaches to data visualization. Complementary to this, many scientists have called for plotting tools that accurately and transparently convey key aspects of statistical effects and raw data with minimal distortion. Previously common approaches, such as plotting conditional mean or median barplots together with error-bars have been criticized for distorting effect size, hiding underlying patterns in the raw data, and obscuring the assumptions upon which the most commonly used statistical tests are based. Here we describe a data visualization approach which overcomes these issues, providing maximal statistical information while preserving the desired `inference at a glance' nature of barplots and other similar visualization devices. These ``raincloud plots'' can visualize raw data, probability density, and key summary statistics such as median, mean, and relevant confidence intervals in an appealing and flexible format with minimal redundancy. In this tutorial paper, we provide basic demonstrations of the strength of raincloud plots and similar approaches, outline potential modifications for their optimal use, and provide open-source code for their streamlined implementation in R, Python and Matlab ( https://github.com/RainCloudPlots/RainCloudPlots). Readers can investigate the R and Python tutorials interactively in the browser using Binder by Project Jupyter.},

In contrast, some popular chart designers wrap the presented data in detailed and elaborate imagery, raising the questions of whether this imagery is really as detrimental to understanding as has been proposed, and whether the visual embellishment may have other benefits. To investigate these issues, we conducted an experiment that compared embellished charts with plain ones, and measured both interpretation accuracy and long-term recall. We found that people's accuracy in describing the embellished charts was no worse than for plain charts, and that their recall after a two-to-three-week gap was significantly better. Although we are cautious about recommending that all charts be produced in this style, our results question some of the premises of the minimalist approach to chart design.},

Audiences are used to hearing an American-influenced accent in many popular genres. Nevertheless, the ``going local'' trend advocated in the British punk era perpetuates in modern music and motivates artists to perform in their local voice. The audience is a driving force behind such trends, but its role has been widely neglected in research. This explorative folk-linguistic study gives center stage to the audience and examines British attitudes toward the American accent both in general and in music, focusing on methodological aspects of attitudes of research in performances. Results show that respondents accept an Americanized singing style and consider it the default mode. However, local British accents are a welcome change and support cultural independence. Findings indicate the importance of working with music stimuli to gather more detailed results on language perception.},

Examination of the disaggregated data reveals few decision-making units that show statistically significant departures from expected frequencies of female admissions, and about as many units appear to favor women as to favor men. If the data are properly pooled, taking into account the autonomy of departmental decision making, thus correcting for the tendency of women to apply to graduate departments that are more difficult for applicants of either sex to enter, there is a small but statistically significant bias in favor of women. The graduate departments that are easier to enter tend to be those that require more mathematics in the undergraduate preparatory curriculum. The bias in the aggregated data stems not from any pattern of discrimination on the part of admissions committees, which seem quite fair on the whole, but apparently from prior screening at earlier levels of the educational system. Women are shunted by their socialization and education toward fields of graduate study that are generally more crowded, less productive of completed degrees, and less well funded, and that frequently offer poorer professional employment prospects.},

However, data storytelling is much more than just effective data visualization. In particular, the powerful narrative aspects have been overlooked or only lightly covered in the marketplace. In addition, very little attention has been spent on the psychological aspects of why stories outperform statistics. This book will introduce much-needed frameworks to better clarify what it means to tell stories with data and offer helpful techniques to be more effective with data storytelling. Most of the current books associated with "data storytelling" focus primarily on just the data visualization aspects, overlooking other essential components such as narrative or audience. While they highlight the importance of communicating insights through data visualizations, they don't drill deeply into the actual storytelling and limit their coverage to a small section or short chapter. In contrast, this book takes a comprehensive look at all aspects of data storytelling--not just the visual elements. This book will: Show how to turn insights into data stories that are more engaging, persuasive, and memorable. Explain why stories are more powerful than just facts or statistics alone. Explain why our brains respond better to data stories. Shows how to avoid common data storytelling mistakes Describe the six essential elements of a data story, the four steps to structuring your findings as a data story, and the seven principles for better visual storytelling. In today's data economy, everyone must be able to communicate effectively with data. It's no longer a skill that is reserved for just data scientists and analysts.

Research approach was to determine the level of usefulness of particular characteristics of visual variables such as selective, associative, quantitative and order. An attempt was made to provide an overview of static visual variables and to describe the AR system which is a new paradigm of the user interface.             Changing the approach to the presentation of point objects is caused by applying different perspective in the observation of objects (egocentric view) than it is done on traditional analogue maps (geocentric view).

This paper extends previous studies and investigates the effects of visual embellishment given different time limits for viewing these charts. Similar to the Bateman et al. (2010) study, we compared embellished charts (selected from the work of Nigel Holmes) and plain, grayscale charts, but we limited our selection to those that consisted of larger data sets (10 or more data points). Results showed that the presence of a time limit affected comprehension and short-term recall performance, while the type of chart significantly affected short-term recall.

  abstract = {Mass media routinely present data on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diffusion with graphs that use either a log scale or a linear scale. We show that the choice of the scale adopted on these graphs has important consequences on how people understand and react to the information conveyed. In particular, we find that when we show the number of COVID-19 related deaths on a logarithmic scale, people have a less accurate understanding of how the pandemic has developed, make less accurate predictions on its evolution, and have different policy preferences than when they are exposed to a linear scale. Consequently, merely changing the scale the data is presented on can alter public policy preferences and the level of worry about the pandemic, despite the fact that people are routinely exposed to COVID-19 related information. Providing the public with information in ways they understand better can help improving the response to COVID-19, thus, mass media and policymakers communicating to the general public should always describe the evolution of the pandemic using a graph on a linear scale, at least as a default option. Our results suggest that framing matters when communicating to the public.},

  abstract = {Data storytelling (DS) is rapidly gaining attention as an approach that integrates data, visuals, and narratives to create data stories that can help a particular audience to comprehend the key messages underscored by the data with enhanced efficiency and effectiveness. It is been posited that DS can be especially advantageous for audiences with limited visualisation literacy, by presenting the data clearly and concisely. However, empirical studies confirming whether data stories indeed provide these benefits over conventional data visualisations are scarce. To bridge this gap, we conducted a study with 103 participants to determine whether DS indeed improve both efficiency and effectiveness in tasks related to information retrieval and insights comprehension. Our findings suggest that data stories do improve the efficiency of comprehension tasks, as well as the effectiveness of comprehension tasks that involve a single insight, compared with conventional visualisations. Interestingly, these benefits were not associated with participants' visualisation literacy.},

  abstract = {While visualizations are an effective way to represent insights about information, they rarely stand alone. When designing a visualization, text is often added to provide additional context and guidance for the reader. However, there is little experimental evidence to guide designers as to what is the right amount of text to show within a chart, what its qualitative properties should be, and where it should be placed. Prior work also shows variation in personal preferences for charts versus textual representations. In this paper, we explore several research questions about the relative value of textual components of visualizations. 302 participants ranked univariate line charts containing varying amounts of text, ranging from no text (except for the axes) to a written paragraph with no visuals. Participants also described what information they could take away from line charts containing text with varying semantic content. We find that heavily annotated charts were not penalized. In fact, participants preferred the charts with the largest number of textual annotations over charts with fewer annotations or text alone. We also find effects of semantic content. For instance, the text that describes statistical or relational components of a chart leads to more takeaways referring to statistics or relational comparisons than text describing elemental or encoded components. Finally, we find different effects for the semantic levels based on the placement of the text on the chart; some kinds of information are best placed in the title, while others should be placed closer to the data. We compile these results into four chart design guidelines and discuss future implications for the combination of text and charts.},

Our systematic review of research articles published in top physiology journals (n = 703) suggests that, as scientists, we urgently need to change our practices for presenting continuous data in small sample size studies. Papers rarely included scatterplots, box plots, and histograms that allow readers to critically evaluate continuous data. Most papers presented continuous data in bar and line graphs. This is problematic, as many different data distributions can lead to the same bar or line graph. The full data may suggest different conclusions from the summary statistics. We recommend training investigators in data presentation, encouraging a more complete presentation of data, and changing journal editorial policies. Investigators can quickly make univariate scatterplots for small sample size studies using our Excel templates.},

Findings from earlier research are tested against further corpus evidence, while I provide a broader statistical basis and more illustrative examples than in previous studies.

I was determined to produce a package that could draw every statistical graphic I had ever seen. The structure of the program was a collection of procedures named after the basic graph types they p- duced. The graphics code was roughly one and a half megabytes in size. In the early 1990's, I redesigned the SYSTAT graphics package using - ject-based technology. I intended to produce a more comprehensive and - namic package. I accomplished this by embedding graphical elements in a tree structure. Rendering graphics was done by walking the tree and editing worked by adding and deleting nodes. The code size fell to under a megabyte. In the late 1990's, I collaborated with Dan Rope at the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Dan Carr at George Mason University to produce a graphics p- duction library called GPL, this time in Java. Our goal was to develop graphics components. This book was nourished by that project. So far, the GPL code size is under half a megabyte.},

  abstract = {Understanding of another person's wrong belief requires explicit representation of the wrongness of this person's belief in relation to one's own knowledge. Three to nine year old children's understanding of two sketches was tested. In each sketch subjects observed how a protagonist put an object into a location x and then witnessed that in the absence of the protagonist the object was transferred from x to location y. Since this transfer came as a surprise they had to assume that the protagonist still believed that the object was in x. Subjects had to indicate where the protagonist will look for the object at his return. None of the 3--4-year old, 57\% of 4--6-year old, and 86\% of 6--9-year old children pointed correctly to location x in both sketches. Of the many cases where 4--6-year olds made an error they failed in only about 20\% to remember the initial location correctly. As a test of the stability of children's representation of the protagonist's wrong belief the sketches continued with a statement about the protagonist's intention to either deceive an antagonist or truthfully inform a friend about the object's location. Independent of age, of those children who correctly thought that the protagonist would search in x, 85\% of the time they also correctly thought that he would direct his antagonist to location y and his friend to location x. This shows that once children can represent a person's beliefs they can constrain their interpretation of this person's stated intentions to the person's beliefs. In a more story-like situation another group of children had to infer a deceptive plan from the depiction of a goal conflict between two story characters and one character's expedient utterance. At the age of 4--5 years children correctly judged this utterance as a lie only 28\% of the time while 5--6-year olds did so 94\% of the time. These results suggest that around the ages of 4 to 6 years the ability to represent the relationship between two or more person's epistemic states emerges and becomes firmly established. R{\'e}sum{\'e} Comprendre que ce que croit un tiers est erron{\'e} requiert une repr{\'e}sentation explicit{\'e}e de cette fausse croyance en relation avec son savoir propre. On a test{\'e} la compr{\'e}hension de deux sketches par des enfants de 3 {\`a} 9 ans. Dans chacun des sketches les sujets observent un protagoniste placer un objet dans un lieu `x', puis sont t{\'e}moins du transfert de cet objet de `x' en `y' en l'absence du protagoniste. Ce transfert doit causer une surprise chez le protagoniste dont on assume qu'il croit que l'objet se trouve toujours en `x'. Les sujets doivent dire o{\`u} le protagoniste va chercher l'objet. Aucun 3--4 ans n'indique correctement le lieu `x', 57\% des 4--6 ans et 86\% des 6--9 ans le font. Parmi les nombreuses erreurs des 4--6 ans seules 20\% sont attribuables {\`a} une incapacit{\'e} de se souvenir du lieu `x'. Pour tester la stabilit{\'e} de la repr{\'e}sentation de la croyance erron{\'e}e, on dit que le protagoniste a l'intention soit de tromper un adversaire soit d'informer un ami sur le lieu o{\`u} se trouve l'objet.
